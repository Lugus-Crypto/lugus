# “Lugus” - Auto Claim Scheduler
Claim tokens, Convert to one token in one click, Schedule pay outs!

## Problem

### General Context:

Right now if you have tokens you can claim on a defi platforms, you have to go in and manually claim cryptos. Also, there can be many types of cryptos to claim from a specific contract - this can be annoying if you just want one sort of crypto. 

Lugus can help you 1. convert those cryptos into either stablecoin or ETH and 2. automatically claim cryptos from contracts according to a configurable schedule.

Additionally, yield aggressors can use this if they want.
